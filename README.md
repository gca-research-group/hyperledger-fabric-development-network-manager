# Fabric Network Orchestrator (FNO)

## Overview

Fabric Network Orchestrator (FNO) is a command-line tool and supporting domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying, validating, and deploying local Hyperledger Fabric networks.

FNO enables developers and researchers to describe Hyperledger Fabric topologies using a declarative specification rather than manually managing configuration files, certificates, deployment scripts, and chaincode lifecycle operations. Before deployment, specifications are validated against a set of formal validation constraints to detect configuration errors early.

The tool supports:

- Network specification through YAML, JSON, and TOML files
- Configuration validation
- Hyperledger Fabric artefact generation
- Certificate and MSP generation
- Network deployment and management
- Chaincode lifecycle management

FNO is primarily intended for:

- Research and experimentation
- Rapid prototyping
- Educational environments
- Local Hyperledger Fabric deployments

## Key Features

- Declarative network specification
- Validation of network configurations before deployment
- Support for channels, organisations, peers, orderers, and chaincodes
- Automated generation of Hyperledger Fabric artefacts
- Automated network provisioning
- Cross-platform execution
- No dependency on external Hyperledger Fabric CLI scripts

## Installation

### Using Prebuilt Binaries

Download the latest release from:

https://github.com/gca-research-group/fabric-network-orchestrator/releases

### Building from Source

Requirements:

- Docker
- Go 1.26 or later

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gca-research-group/fabric-network-orchestrator
cd fabric-network-orchestrator

go mod tidy
```

## Command Workflow

### Validate a Configuration

```bash
fno configuration validate --config samples/minimal-network.yml
```

### Generate Artefacts

```bash
fno artifacts generate --config samples/minimal-network.yml
```

Generates:

- Cryptographic material
- MSP structures
- TLS certificates
- Channel configuration artefacts
- Docker Compose descriptors

### Deploy a Network

```bash
fno network deploy --config samples/minimal-network.yml
```

This command performs:

1. Configuration validation
2. Identity generation
3. Artefact generation
4. Network provisioning
5. Channel creation and joining
6. Chaincode deployment (when configured)

### Manage Network Lifecycle

```bash
fno network up --config samples/minimal-network.yml
fno network down --config samples/minimal-network.yml
```

### Deploy Chaincodes

```bash
fno chaincode deploy --config samples/minimal-network.yml
```

### Clean Generated Artefacts

```bash
fno artifacts clean --config samples/minimal-network.yml
```

## Configuration Example

```yaml
output: output/minimal-network

  channel: V2_0
  orderer: V2_0

```

## Validation Constraints

FNO validates specifications before deployment using the following 44 rules. The rule ID is included in each validation error and is also used by the experiment runner to identify the mutation applied to a scenario.

Invalid configurations are rejected before artefacts are generated or infrastructure is provisioned.

## Experiment Runner

The developer-only experiment runner is implemented under [`internal/experiment`](./internal/experiment/) and launched from [`cmd/experiment-runner`](./cmd/experiment-runner/):

- `generator` contains mutation operators for all 44 validation rules. Each operator starts from a valid seed configuration, introduces a targeted fault, and records the expected rule ID. Scenarios combine three compatible rule groups, with at most one mutation selected from each group; structurally incompatible mutations are explicitly excluded.
- `runner` streams the generated manifest, validates every scenario configuration, and checks that the reported validation rules include all mutations expected for that scenario.

Run its verification tests with:

```bash
go test ./internal/experiment/...
```

Generate the scenario corpus with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/experiment-runner
```

The command exhaustively generates and runs the complete scenario corpus without retaining it in memory. Combinations, the manifest, and execution results are processed incrementally. It writes mutated configurations to `output/config/`, the scenario-to-rule mapping to `output/scenarios.json`, and execution results to `output/results.json`. Each result is `passed` when all expected rules are reported, `partial` when only some are reported, or `failed` when none are reported or the configuration cannot be processed. Missing rules are included in the result. The command exits with a non-zero status when any scenario is partial or failed.
