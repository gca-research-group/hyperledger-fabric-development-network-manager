## Overview

Setting up a Hyperledger Fabric network can be a challenging task, even for experienced professionals. For those who are just starting out, or even for those who simply want to try the network in development mode, building the network can be time-consuming and requires a great deal of knowledge. The Hyperledger Fabric Development Network Manager is an open-source, free-to-use tool that aims to address this challenge by offering high-level abstractions. On the one hand, abstractions hide implementation and configuration details; on the other hand, we don't need to worry about these details if we're just learning how the network works or applying it to a business problem.
